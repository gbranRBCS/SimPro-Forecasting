The test involves switching off the mains power to the emergency lighting system and checking that the emergency lights come on and remain illuminated. If any faults or issues are identified during the monthly test, they should be addressed as soon as possible. &nbsp;How do you Test Emergency Lighting?There are different ways to test emergency lighting in the UK, depending on the type of emergency lighting system and the requirements of the relevant regulations and standards. However, the following is a general procedure for testing emergency lighting:&nbsp;Emergency Monthly TestingThe monthly test is a functional test that checks that the emergency lighting system is working correctly. To carry out the monthly test, you should:Simulate a power failure by either an emergency key switch or by switching off the mains power to the emergency lighting.Observe that the emergency lighting comes on automatically.Check that the emergency lights remain illuminated for the required duration (usually 10 minutes or as required by the relevant regulations or standards).Record the results of the test on Simpro and in the emergency log book if applicable.&nbsp;Asset ID 3599 - Asset Type Emergency Light - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 14/11/2025Asset ID 3632 - Asset Type Emergency Light - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 14/11/2025",

      "descriptionText": "Temperatures of outlets to be tested on a monthly basis.&nbsp;Checking the temperature from the hot tapsUsing an accurate thermometer, check the water flow from a chosen hot tap. When doing this for the first time, the tap furthest away from the calorifier/water heater/boiler should be chosen, this is sometimes called a sentinel outlet.Other representative points can then also be checked in a chosen pattern, eventually repeating the pattern so different taps are checked monthly.Here are the main points to note:Hold the thermometer in the hot water flow for one minuteRecord the temperature on the thermometerIt should be a minimum of 50 degrees Celsius after one minuteIf it is below this, advise whoever oversees the site so the necessary actions can be taken to remedy the issueIf&nbsp;thermostatic mixing valves&nbsp;(TMVs) are fitted, these ensure the temperature never exceeds 44 degrees Celsius primarily to prevent hot water scalding. In this case, the hot water inlet to the TMV should be checked instead of the hot taps. Again, a minimum of 50 degrees Celsius should be recorded in this instance.With a TMV fitted water temperatures at the hot tap should not exceed 44 degrees Celsius.Checking the temperature from water heaters (calorifiers)On a monthly basis check the water flow and return temperatures at water heaters (calorifiers). One way of measuring these temperatures is to use a surface temperature probe. The outgoing water should be at least 60 &deg;C in order to kill Legionella bacteria.Temperatures from cold tapsA similar pattern should be followed to that described for hot water above. Formulate a pattern for rotating through different cold taps each month:Hold the thermometer in the cold water flow for two minutesRecord the temperature after two minutesIt should be a maximum of 20 degrees Celsius or belowReport and action as above if it goes above thisOther water checks to makeMake a monthly check of water temperatures of the flow and return from and to the calorifier (see above).Keeping accurate records is of paramount importance.Asset ID 6146 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 26/11/2025Asset ID 6151 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 26/11/2025Asset ID 6153 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 26/11/2025Asset ID 6157 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 26/11/2025Asset ID 6162 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 26/11/2025Asset ID 6167 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 26/11/2025",

      "descriptionText": "Temperatures of outlets to be tested on a monthly basis.&nbsp;Checking the temperature from the hot tapsUsing an accurate thermometer, check the water flow from a chosen hot tap. When doing this for the first time, the tap furthest away from the calorifier/water heater/boiler should be chosen, this is sometimes called a sentinel outlet.Other representative points can then also be checked in a chosen pattern, eventually repeating the pattern so different taps are checked monthly.Here are the main points to note:Hold the thermometer in the hot water flow for one minuteRecord the temperature on the thermometerIt should be a minimum of 50 degrees Celsius after one minuteIf it is below this, advise whoever oversees the site so the necessary actions can be taken to remedy the issueIf&nbsp;thermostatic mixing valves&nbsp;(TMVs) are fitted, these ensure the temperature never exceeds 44 degrees Celsius primarily to prevent hot water scalding. In this case, the hot water inlet to the TMV should be checked instead of the hot taps. Again, a minimum of 50 degrees Celsius should be recorded in this instance.With a TMV fitted water temperatures at the hot tap should not exceed 44 degrees Celsius.Checking the temperature from water heaters (calorifiers)On a monthly basis check the water flow and return temperatures at water heaters (calorifiers). One way of measuring these temperatures is to use a surface temperature probe. The outgoing water should be at least 60 &deg;C in order to kill Legionella bacteria.Temperatures from cold tapsA similar pattern should be followed to that described for hot water above. Formulate a pattern for rotating through different cold taps each month:Hold the thermometer in the cold water flow for two minutesRecord the temperature after two minutesIt should be a maximum of 20 degrees Celsius or belowReport and action as above if it goes above thisOther water checks to makeMake a monthly check of water temperatures of the flow and return from and to the calorifier (see above).Keeping accurate records is of paramount importance.Asset ID 5091 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 23/12/2025Asset ID 5101 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 23/12/2025Asset ID 5102 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 23/12/2025Asset ID 5107 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 23/12/2025Asset ID 5109 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 23/12/2025",

When doing this for the first time, the tap furthest away from the calorifier/water heater/boiler should be chosen, this is sometimes called a sentinel outlet.Other representative points can then also be checked in a chosen pattern, eventually repeating the pattern so different taps are checked monthly.Here are the main points to note:Hold the thermometer in the hot water flow for one minuteRecord the temperature on the thermometerIt should be a minimum of 50 degrees Celsius after one minuteIf it is below this, advise whoever oversees the site so the necessary actions can be taken to remedy the issueIf&nbsp;thermostatic mixing valves&nbsp;(TMVs) are fitted, these ensure the temperature never exceeds 44 degrees Celsius primarily to prevent hot water scalding. In this case, the hot water inlet to the TMV should be checked instead of the hot taps. Again, a minimum of 50 degrees Celsius should be recorded in this instance.With a TMV fitted water temperatures at the hot tap should not exceed 44 degrees Celsius.Checking the temperature from water heaters (calorifiers)On a monthly basis check the water flow and return temperatures at water heaters (calorifiers). One way of measuring these temperatures is to use a surface temperature probe. The outgoing water should be at least 60 &deg;C in order to kill Legionella bacteria.Temperatures from cold tapsA similar pattern should be followed to that described for hot water above. Formulate a pattern for rotating through different cold taps each month:Hold the thermometer in the cold water flow for two minutesRecord the temperature after two minutesIt should be a maximum of 20 degrees Celsius or belowReport and action as above if it goes above thisOther water checks to makeMake a monthly check of water temperatures of the flow and return from and to the calorifier (see above).Keeping accurate records is of paramount importance.Asset ID 3533 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 13/11/2025Asset ID 3538 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 13/11/2025Asset ID 3543 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 13/11/2025Asset ID 3544 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 13/11/2025Asset ID 3547 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 13/11/2025Asset ID 3550 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 13/11/2025Asset ID 3551 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 13/11/2025Asset ID 3557 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 13/11/2025Asset ID 3558 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 13/11/2025Asset ID 3561 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 13/11/2025",

      "descriptionText": "Temperatures of outlets to be tested on a monthly basis.&nbsp;Checking the temperature from the hot tapsUsing an accurate thermometer, check the water flow from a chosen hot tap. When doing this for the first time, the tap furthest away from the calorifier/water heater/boiler should be chosen, this is sometimes called a sentinel outlet.Other representative points can then also be checked in a chosen pattern, eventually repeating the pattern so different taps are checked monthly.Here are the main points to note:Hold the thermometer in the hot water flow for one minuteRecord the temperature on the thermometerIt should be a minimum of 50 degrees Celsius after one minuteIf it is below this, advise whoever oversees the site so the necessary actions can be taken to remedy the issueIf&nbsp;thermostatic mixing valves&nbsp;(TMVs) are fitted, these ensure the temperature never exceeds 44 degrees Celsius primarily to prevent hot water scalding. In this case, the hot water inlet to the TMV should be checked instead of the hot taps. Again, a minimum of 50 degrees Celsius should be recorded in this instance.With a TMV fitted water temperatures at the hot tap should not exceed 44 degrees Celsius.Checking the temperature from water heaters (calorifiers)On a monthly basis check the water flow and return temperatures at water heaters (calorifiers). One way of measuring these temperatures is to use a surface temperature probe. The outgoing water should be at least 60 &deg;C in order to kill Legionella bacteria.Temperatures from cold tapsA similar pattern should be followed to that described for hot water above. Formulate a pattern for rotating through different cold taps each month:Hold the thermometer in the cold water flow for two minutesRecord the temperature after two minutesIt should be a maximum of 20 degrees Celsius or belowReport and action as above if it goes above thisOther water checks to makeMake a monthly check of water temperatures of the flow and return from and to the calorifier (see above).Keeping accurate records is of paramount importance.Asset ID 5250 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 26/11/2025Asset ID 5257 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 26/11/2025Asset ID 5261 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 26/11/2025Asset ID 5267 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 26/11/2025Asset ID 5272 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 26/11/2025",

Please take photos of existing control set up and the exact client requirements so we can propose a solution.&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Site survey to investigate and propose an access control solution to facilitate extended opening hours without Padel staff being present. I have sent an enquiry email to a supplier as per below to get things moving so we have some options:&nbsp;&nbsp;Please could you provide budgetary costs and a technical data sheet for supplying Weblock automatic access facilities to seven paddle courts, similar to the solution shown in your online case study.The courts are located in Maidenhead, Berkshire.In addition, it would be helpful if you could advise on:Typical lead times from order to installationAny infrastructure or power requirementsOngoing maintenance or licensing considerationsWe would also welcome the opportunity for a site visit and demonstration. If possible, please let us know your availability to attend site with a sample unit to review suitability and operation in person.3) Revise the cost for external speakers by reducing the number of speaker points- send over to jade and Phil with lead times etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we get Ben down there as he is familiar with the site one morning or afternoon this week please.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional info: Access control needs to interface with Playtomic add&nbsp;If Playtomic has supplied you with hardware for your keypad entry and lights, then there are a couple of things you should know how to do in your back office.&nbsp;The most important to know is that every reservation, generates a new PIN code for access. The pin code for the reservation is emailed to the player in the reservation confirmation email and can also be found in the app and you can also see this in your back office.&nbsp;IN THE APP&nbsp;IN THE BACK OFFICEBy default the pin code is active 30 mins before the reservation starts during the reservation time and up to 15 mins after.&nbsp;You do have the opportunity to change this in your back office if the above does not suit your players.&nbsp;Just go to Settings &gt; Center and scroll down to this field:&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE - You must complete both fields for this to change.&nbsp;&nbsp;GENERAL ACCESS CODESThese will be used for staff members or alike and you can create your own access codes in SETTINGS &gt; ACCESS CODES. These codes never expire and you can edit and create new ones whenever you need.Hello Andy! Thank you for contacting&nbsp;Playtomic. 🎾&nbsp;My name is Marloes, and I&rsquo;m happy to help with your enquiry today. 😊&nbsp;Playtomic&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t directly offer an automated access control system, but we do have possible integrations with several companies that provide this kind of solution. To explore these options, just head to your&nbsp;Playtomic&nbsp;Manager dashboard and go to&nbsp;Settings &gt; Integrations &gt; Connect New. There you&rsquo;ll find a list of providers that can be connected to your&nbsp;Playtomic&nbsp;account.&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll need to choose the provider you want to work with first. Each company listed will have their own pricing, installation steps, infrastructure needs, and lead times. For details like datasheets, demos, and exact instructions, it&rsquo;s best to reach out to them directly. Once you pick a provider, they&rsquo;ll guide you on how to connect their system with&nbsp;Playtomic&nbsp;and provide you with the necessary API key.&nbsp;Once you connect with one of the companies, if you need step-by-step help connecting an integration into&nbsp;Playtomic, you can check out our guide here:&nbsp;How to connect integrations in&nbsp;Playtomic&nbsp;Manager&nbsp;Let me know if you&rsquo;d like more info or if you have any other questions!&nbsp;Kind regards,Marloes&nbsp;&nbsp;Playtomic Customer Care Team&nbsp;",

      "descriptionText": "Temperatures of outlets to be tested on a monthly basis.&nbsp;Checking the temperature from the hot tapsUsing an accurate thermometer, check the water flow from a chosen hot tap. When doing this for the first time, the tap furthest away from the calorifier/water heater/boiler should be chosen, this is sometimes called a sentinel outlet.Other representative points can then also be checked in a chosen pattern, eventually repeating the pattern so different taps are checked monthly.Here are the main points to note:Hold the thermometer in the hot water flow for one minuteRecord the temperature on the thermometerIt should be a minimum of 50 degrees Celsius after one minuteIf it is below this, advise whoever oversees the site so the necessary actions can be taken to remedy the issueIf&nbsp;thermostatic mixing valves&nbsp;(TMVs) are fitted, these ensure the temperature never exceeds 44 degrees Celsius primarily to prevent hot water scalding. In this case, the hot water inlet to the TMV should be checked instead of the hot taps. Again, a minimum of 50 degrees Celsius should be recorded in this instance.With a TMV fitted water temperatures at the hot tap should not exceed 44 degrees Celsius.Checking the temperature from water heaters (calorifiers)On a monthly basis check the water flow and return temperatures at water heaters (calorifiers). One way of measuring these temperatures is to use a surface temperature probe. The outgoing water should be at least 60 &deg;C in order to kill Legionella bacteria.Temperatures from cold tapsA similar pattern should be followed to that described for hot water above.

      "descriptionText": "Temperatures of outlets to be tested on a monthly basis.&nbsp;Checking the temperature from the hot tapsUsing an accurate thermometer, check the water flow from a chosen hot tap. When doing this for the first time, the tap furthest away from the calorifier/water heater/boiler should be chosen, this is sometimes called a sentinel outlet.Other representative points can then also be checked in a chosen pattern, eventually repeating the pattern so different taps are checked monthly.Here are the main points to note:Hold the thermometer in the hot water flow for one minuteRecord the temperature on the thermometerIt should be a minimum of 50 degrees Celsius after one minuteIf it is below this, advise whoever oversees the site so the necessary actions can be taken to remedy the issueIf&nbsp;thermostatic mixing valves&nbsp;(TMVs) are fitted, these ensure the temperature never exceeds 44 degrees Celsius primarily to prevent hot water scalding. In this case, the hot water inlet to the TMV should be checked instead of the hot taps. Again, a minimum of 50 degrees Celsius should be recorded in this instance.With a TMV fitted water temperatures at the hot tap should not exceed 44 degrees Celsius.Checking the temperature from water heaters (calorifiers)On a monthly basis check the water flow and return temperatures at water heaters (calorifiers). One way of measuring these temperatures is to use a surface temperature probe. The outgoing water should be at least 60 &deg;C in order to kill Legionella bacteria.Temperatures from cold tapsA similar pattern should be followed to that described for hot water above. Formulate a pattern for rotating through different cold taps each month:Hold the thermometer in the cold water flow for two minutesRecord the temperature after two minutesIt should be a maximum of 20 degrees Celsius or belowReport and action as above if it goes above thisOther water checks to makeMake a monthly check of water temperatures of the flow and return from and to the calorifier (see above).Keeping accurate records is of paramount importance.",

Then replaced head and left with radiator fully operational and producing good heat temperature.

When doing this for the first time, the tap furthest away from the calorifier/water heater/boiler should be chosen, this is sometimes called a sentinel outlet.Other representative points can then also be checked in a chosen pattern, eventually repeating the pattern so different taps are checked monthly.Here are the main points to note:Hold the thermometer in the hot water flow for one minuteRecord the temperature on the thermometerIt should be a minimum of 50 degrees Celsius after one minuteIf it is below this, advise whoever oversees the site so the necessary actions can be taken to remedy the issueIf&nbsp;thermostatic mixing valves&nbsp;(TMVs) are fitted, these ensure the temperature never exceeds 44 degrees Celsius primarily to prevent hot water scalding. In this case, the hot water inlet to the TMV should be checked instead of the hot taps. Again, a minimum of 50 degrees Celsius should be recorded in this instance.With a TMV fitted water temperatures at the hot tap should not exceed 44 degrees Celsius.Checking the temperature from water heaters (calorifiers)On a monthly basis check the water flow and return temperatures at water heaters (calorifiers). One way of measuring these temperatures is to use a surface temperature probe. The outgoing water should be at least 60 &deg;C in order to kill Legionella bacteria.Temperatures from cold tapsA similar pattern should be followed to that described for hot water above. Formulate a pattern for rotating through different cold taps each month:Hold the thermometer in the cold water flow for two minutesRecord the temperature after two minutesIt should be a maximum of 20 degrees Celsius or belowReport and action as above if it goes above thisOther water checks to makeMake a monthly check of water temperatures of the flow and return from and to the calorifier (see above).Keeping accurate records is of paramount importance.",
