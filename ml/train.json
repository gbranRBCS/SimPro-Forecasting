      "descriptionText": "Temperatures of outlets to be tested on a monthly basis.&nbsp;Checking the temperature from the hot tapsUsing an accurate thermometer, check the water flow from a chosen hot tap. When doing this for the first time, the tap furthest away from the calorifier/water heater/boiler should be chosen, this is sometimes called a sentinel outlet.Other representative points can then also be checked in a chosen pattern, eventually repeating the pattern so different taps are checked monthly.Here are the main points to note:Hold the thermometer in the hot water flow for one minuteRecord the temperature on the thermometerIt should be a minimum of 50 degrees Celsius after one minuteIf it is below this, advise whoever oversees the site so the necessary actions can be taken to remedy the issueIf&nbsp;thermostatic mixing valves&nbsp;(TMVs) are fitted, these ensure the temperature never exceeds 44 degrees Celsius primarily to prevent hot water scalding. In this case, the hot water inlet to the TMV should be checked instead of the hot taps. Again, a minimum of 50 degrees Celsius should be recorded in this instance.With a TMV fitted water temperatures at the hot tap should not exceed 44 degrees Celsius.Checking the temperature from water heaters (calorifiers)On a monthly basis check the water flow and return temperatures at water heaters (calorifiers). One way of measuring these temperatures is to use a surface temperature probe. The outgoing water should be at least 60 &deg;C in order to kill Legionella bacteria.Temperatures from cold tapsA similar pattern should be followed to that described for hot water above. Formulate a pattern for rotating through different cold taps each month:Hold the thermometer in the cold water flow for two minutesRecord the temperature after two minutesIt should be a maximum of 20 degrees Celsius or belowReport and action as above if it goes above thisOther water checks to makeMake a monthly check of water temperatures of the flow and return from and to the calorifier (see above).Keeping accurate records is of paramount importance.Asset ID 4600 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 27/10/2025Asset ID 4603 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 27/10/2025Asset ID 4607 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 27/10/2025Asset ID 4608 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 27/10/2025Asset ID 4611 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 27/10/2025Asset ID 4612 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 27/10/2025Asset ID 4616 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 27/10/2025Asset ID 4617 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 27/10/2025Asset ID 4621 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 27/10/2025",

      "descriptionText": "Temperatures of outlets to be tested on a monthly basis.&nbsp;Checking the temperature from the hot tapsUsing an accurate thermometer, check the water flow from a chosen hot tap. When doing this for the first time, the tap furthest away from the calorifier/water heater/boiler should be chosen, this is sometimes called a sentinel outlet.Other representative points can then also be checked in a chosen pattern, eventually repeating the pattern so different taps are checked monthly.Here are the main points to note:Hold the thermometer in the hot water flow for one minuteRecord the temperature on the thermometerIt should be a minimum of 50 degrees Celsius after one minuteIf it is below this, advise whoever oversees the site so the necessary actions can be taken to remedy the issueIf&nbsp;thermostatic mixing valves&nbsp;(TMVs) are fitted, these ensure the temperature never exceeds 44 degrees Celsius primarily to prevent hot water scalding. In this case, the hot water inlet to the TMV should be checked instead of the hot taps. Again, a minimum of 50 degrees Celsius should be recorded in this instance.With a TMV fitted water temperatures at the hot tap should not exceed 44 degrees Celsius.Checking the temperature from water heaters (calorifiers)On a monthly basis check the water flow and return temperatures at water heaters (calorifiers). One way of measuring these temperatures is to use a surface temperature probe. The outgoing water should be at least 60 &deg;C in order to kill Legionella bacteria.Temperatures from cold tapsA similar pattern should be followed to that described for hot water above. Formulate a pattern for rotating through different cold taps each month:Hold the thermometer in the cold water flow for two minutesRecord the temperature after two minutesIt should be a maximum of 20 degrees Celsius or belowReport and action as above if it goes above thisOther water checks to makeMake a monthly check of water temperatures of the flow and return from and to the calorifier (see above).Keeping accurate records is of paramount importance.Asset ID 4925 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 28/10/2025Asset ID 4927 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 28/10/2025Asset ID 4930 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 28/10/2025Asset ID 4933 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 28/10/2025Asset ID 4936 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 28/10/2025Asset ID 4939 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 28/10/2025Asset ID 4941 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 28/10/2025Asset ID 4943 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 28/10/2025",

      "descriptionText": "Temperatures of outlets to be tested on a monthly basis.&nbsp;Checking the temperature from the hot tapsUsing an accurate thermometer, check the water flow from a chosen hot tap. When doing this for the first time, the tap furthest away from the calorifier/water heater/boiler should be chosen, this is sometimes called a sentinel outlet.Other representative points can then also be checked in a chosen pattern, eventually repeating the pattern so different taps are checked monthly.Here are the main points to note:Hold the thermometer in the hot water flow for one minuteRecord the temperature on the thermometerIt should be a minimum of 50 degrees Celsius after one minuteIf it is below this, advise whoever oversees the site so the necessary actions can be taken to remedy the issueIf&nbsp;thermostatic mixing valves&nbsp;(TMVs) are fitted, these ensure the temperature never exceeds 44 degrees Celsius primarily to prevent hot water scalding. In this case, the hot water inlet to the TMV should be checked instead of the hot taps. Again, a minimum of 50 degrees Celsius should be recorded in this instance.With a TMV fitted water temperatures at the hot tap should not exceed 44 degrees Celsius.Checking the temperature from water heaters (calorifiers)On a monthly basis check the water flow and return temperatures at water heaters (calorifiers). One way of measuring these temperatures is to use a surface temperature probe. The outgoing water should be at least 60 &deg;C in order to kill Legionella bacteria.Temperatures from cold tapsA similar pattern should be followed to that described for hot water above. Formulate a pattern for rotating through different cold taps each month:Hold the thermometer in the cold water flow for two minutesRecord the temperature after two minutesIt should be a maximum of 20 degrees Celsius or belowReport and action as above if it goes above thisOther water checks to makeMake a monthly check of water temperatures of the flow and return from and to the calorifier (see above).Keeping accurate records is of paramount importance.Asset ID 5058 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 30/10/2025Asset ID 5060 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 30/10/2025Asset ID 5063 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 30/10/2025Asset ID 5066 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 30/10/2025Asset ID 5069 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 30/10/2025Asset ID 5071 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 30/10/2025Asset ID 5074 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 30/10/2025Asset ID 5076 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 30/10/2025Asset ID 5078 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 30/10/2025Asset ID 5081 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 30/10/2025Asset ID 5084 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 30/10/2025",

      "descriptionText": "Temperatures of outlets to be tested on a monthly basis.&nbsp;Checking the temperature from the hot tapsUsing an accurate thermometer, check the water flow from a chosen hot tap. When doing this for the first time, the tap furthest away from the calorifier/water heater/boiler should be chosen, this is sometimes called a sentinel outlet.Other representative points can then also be checked in a chosen pattern, eventually repeating the pattern so different taps are checked monthly.Here are the main points to note:Hold the thermometer in the hot water flow for one minuteRecord the temperature on the thermometerIt should be a minimum of 50 degrees Celsius after one minuteIf it is below this, advise whoever oversees the site so the necessary actions can be taken to remedy the issueIf&nbsp;thermostatic mixing valves&nbsp;(TMVs) are fitted, these ensure the temperature never exceeds 44 degrees Celsius primarily to prevent hot water scalding. In this case, the hot water inlet to the TMV should be checked instead of the hot taps. Again, a minimum of 50 degrees Celsius should be recorded in this instance.With a TMV fitted water temperatures at the hot tap should not exceed 44 degrees Celsius.Checking the temperature from water heaters (calorifiers)On a monthly basis check the water flow and return temperatures at water heaters (calorifiers). One way of measuring these temperatures is to use a surface temperature probe. The outgoing water should be at least 60 &deg;C in order to kill Legionella bacteria.Temperatures from cold tapsA similar pattern should be followed to that described for hot water above. Formulate a pattern for rotating through different cold taps each month:Hold the thermometer in the cold water flow for two minutesRecord the temperature after two minutesIt should be a maximum of 20 degrees Celsius or belowReport and action as above if it goes above thisOther water checks to makeMake a monthly check of water temperatures of the flow and return from and to the calorifier (see above).Keeping accurate records is of paramount importance.Asset ID 4678 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 27/10/2025Asset ID 4675 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 27/10/2025Asset ID 4672 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 27/10/2025Asset ID 4670 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 27/10/2025Asset ID 4668 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 27/10/2025Asset ID 4667 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 27/10/2025Asset ID 4665 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 27/10/2025Asset ID 4663 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 27/10/2025Asset ID 4660 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 27/10/2025Asset ID 4658 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 27/10/2025Asset ID 4655 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 27/10/2025",

When doing this for the first time, the tap furthest away from the calorifier/water heater/boiler should be chosen, this is sometimes called a sentinel outlet.Other representative points can then also be checked in a chosen pattern, eventually repeating the pattern so different taps are checked monthly.Here are the main points to note:Hold the thermometer in the hot water flow for one minuteRecord the temperature on the thermometerIt should be a minimum of 50 degrees Celsius after one minuteIf it is below this, advise whoever oversees the site so the necessary actions can be taken to remedy the issueIf&nbsp;thermostatic mixing valves&nbsp;(TMVs) are fitted, these ensure the temperature never exceeds 44 degrees Celsius primarily to prevent hot water scalding. In this case, the hot water inlet to the TMV should be checked instead of the hot taps. Again, a minimum of 50 degrees Celsius should be recorded in this instance.With a TMV fitted water temperatures at the hot tap should not exceed 44 degrees Celsius.Checking the temperature from water heaters (calorifiers)On a monthly basis check the water flow and return temperatures at water heaters (calorifiers). One way of measuring these temperatures is to use a surface temperature probe. The outgoing water should be at least 60 &deg;C in order to kill Legionella bacteria.Temperatures from cold tapsA similar pattern should be followed to that described for hot water above. Formulate a pattern for rotating through different cold taps each month:Hold the thermometer in the cold water flow for two minutesRecord the temperature after two minutesIt should be a maximum of 20 degrees Celsius or belowReport and action as above if it goes above thisOther water checks to makeMake a monthly check of water temperatures of the flow and return from and to the calorifier (see above).Keeping accurate records is of paramount importance.",

      "descriptionText": "Temperatures of outlets to be tested on a monthly basis.&nbsp;Checking the temperature from the hot tapsUsing an accurate thermometer, check the water flow from a chosen hot tap. When doing this for the first time, the tap furthest away from the calorifier/water heater/boiler should be chosen, this is sometimes called a sentinel outlet.Other representative points can then also be checked in a chosen pattern, eventually repeating the pattern so different taps are checked monthly.Here are the main points to note:Hold the thermometer in the hot water flow for one minuteRecord the temperature on the thermometerIt should be a minimum of 50 degrees Celsius after one minuteIf it is below this, advise whoever oversees the site so the necessary actions can be taken to remedy the issueIf&nbsp;thermostatic mixing valves&nbsp;(TMVs) are fitted, these ensure the temperature never exceeds 44 degrees Celsius primarily to prevent hot water scalding. In this case, the hot water inlet to the TMV should be checked instead of the hot taps. Again, a minimum of 50 degrees Celsius should be recorded in this instance.With a TMV fitted water temperatures at the hot tap should not exceed 44 degrees Celsius.Checking the temperature from water heaters (calorifiers)On a monthly basis check the water flow and return temperatures at water heaters (calorifiers). One way of measuring these temperatures is to use a surface temperature probe. The outgoing water should be at least 60 &deg;C in order to kill Legionella bacteria.Temperatures from cold tapsA similar pattern should be followed to that described for hot water above. Formulate a pattern for rotating through different cold taps each month:Hold the thermometer in the cold water flow for two minutesRecord the temperature after two minutesIt should be a maximum of 20 degrees Celsius or belowReport and action as above if it goes above thisOther water checks to makeMake a monthly check of water temperatures of the flow and return from and to the calorifier (see above).Keeping accurate records is of paramount importance.Asset ID 4886 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 28/10/2025Asset ID 4887 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 28/10/2025Asset ID 4889 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 28/10/2025Asset ID 4892 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 28/10/2025Asset ID 4895 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 28/10/2025Asset ID 4897 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 28/10/2025Asset ID 4898 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 28/10/2025Asset ID 4901 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 28/10/2025Asset ID 4903 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 28/10/2025Asset ID 4905 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 28/10/2025Asset ID 4908 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 28/10/2025Asset ID 4911 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 28/10/2025Asset ID 4914 - Asset Type Water Outlet - Service Level Monthly - Service Due Date 28/10/2025",

I completed full drying of all electrical connection and pcb controls boards and enclosure. Tested integrity and then replaced fast blow internal fuse, the boiler is now fully operational and controls are working correctly, I would however recommend these controls module get raised at least 100mm off the surface of boiler to prevent this happening and reduce risk of complete failure of PCB controls.&nbsp;",

After investigating I found the water heater to be pulling 12.5amp/3kw. With this being so close to the breaking capacity of the fuse and it being constantly on 24/7 I believe it has just got too hot over time and eventually burnt out. A replacement of a 16amp rotary isolator may be needed&nbsp;",
